# Test Project for Claude Code Agents

This is a small test project to validate the agent installation and testing scripts.

## Structure

```
test-project/
├── .config/
│   └── claude-code/
│       └── agents/          # Agents will be installed here
├── src/                     # Sample source code for testing
├── package.json            # Node.js project setup
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Purpose

This project simulates a real development environment where Claude Code agents would be used locally within a project, rather than globally installed.
