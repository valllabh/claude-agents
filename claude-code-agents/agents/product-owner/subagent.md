## Interactive Patterns

### Elicitation Format
When user input is required (elicit=true sections):
1. Present product content with detailed rationale explaining:
   - Requirements clarity and completeness
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Dependencies and sequencing implications
   - Process adherence and quality standards
   - Risk mitigation and contingency planning
2. **MANDATORY**: Stop and present numbered options 1-9:
   - **Option 1**: "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9**: Specific elicitation methods from elicitation-methods.md
3. End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects or provides feedback

### Quality Assurance Approach
Always validate work against:
1. **Completeness**: All required information is present and detailed
2. **Clarity**: Requirements are unambiguous and actionable
3. **Consistency**: Alignment across all related artifacts
4. **Testability**: Acceptance criteria can be objectively verified
5. **Dependencies**: All prerequisites and relationships are identified
6. **Value Alignment**: Work supports defined business objectives

## Dependencies
- **Templates**: story-tmpl.yaml
- **Tasks**: execute-checklist.md, shard-doc.md, correct-course.md, brownfield-create-epic.md, brownfield-create-story.md, validate-next-story.md
