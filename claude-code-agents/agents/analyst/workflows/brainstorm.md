# Brainstorming Facilitation Workflow

## Overview
Structured brainstorming session facilitation using systematic methodologies to generate, organize, and prioritize ideas.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Define Scope and Objectives
**Actions:**
- Clarify brainstorming topic and context
- Establish session goals and success criteria
- Identify constraints, parameters, and boundaries
- Determine target outcomes and deliverables

**Questions to Address:**
- What specific problem or opportunity are we exploring?
- Who is the target audience or user base?
- What are the resource constraints?
- What timeline are we working within?

### 2. Select Brainstorming Technique
**Available Techniques from brainstorming-techniques.md:**
- Classic Brainstorming (quantity over quality)
- Mind Mapping (visual association)
- SCAMPER Method (systematic creativity)
- Six Thinking Hats (perspective-based)
- Brainwriting (silent generation)
- Reverse Brainstorming (problem-focused)
- Starbursting (question-focused)
- Nominal Group Technique (structured ranking)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Group size and dynamics
- Problem complexity
- Time available
- Desired outcome type

### 3. Facilitate Ideation Session
**Setup Phase:**
- Present selected technique methodology
- Establish ground rules (no criticism, build on ideas, quantity focus)
- Set time boundaries for each phase
- Create psychological safety for creative thinking

**Generation Phase:**
- Guide participants through technique-specific steps
- Encourage wild ideas and creative thinking
- Build on others' ideas and make connections
- Maintain energy and momentum
- Capture all ideas without judgment

**Clarification Phase:**
- Review generated ideas for understanding
- Group similar concepts together
- Clarify ambiguous or unclear ideas
- Ensure comprehensive capture

### 4. Organize and Structure Ideas
**Categorization:**
- Group related ideas into themes
- Identify patterns and connections
- Create logical categories or clusters
- Note unique or outlier concepts

**Documentation:**
- Record all ideas systematically
- Maintain idea attribution where relevant
- Create visual representations when helpful
- Preserve original wording and intent

### 5. Evaluate and Prioritize
**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Feasibility and resource requirements
- Impact and potential value
- Alignment with objectives
- Risk and complexity levels
- Time to implementation

**Prioritization Methods:**
- Dot voting for quick consensus
- Impact/Effort matrix plotting
- Weighted scoring against criteria
- MoSCoW method (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Forced ranking exercises

### 6. Generate Actionable Output
**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive idea inventory
- Prioritized recommendation list
- Implementation feasibility assessment
- Next steps and action items
- Resource requirement estimates

**Output Format:**
Use brainstorming-output-tmpl.yaml template structure:
- Session summary and context
- Methodology used and rationale
- Complete idea inventory with categorization
- Prioritization results and criteria
- Top recommendations with justification
- Implementation roadmap and next steps
