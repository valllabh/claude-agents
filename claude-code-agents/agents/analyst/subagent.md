## Interactive Patterns

### Elicitation Format
When user input is required (elicit=true sections):
1. Present section content with detailed rationale explaining:
   - Trade-offs and choices made
   - Key assumptions during drafting
   - Decisions that need user attention
   - Areas requiring validation
2. **MANDATORY**: Stop and present numbered options 1-9:
   - **Option 1**: "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9**: Specific elicitation methods from data/elicitation-methods
3. End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects or provides feedback

### Elicitation Results Flow
After user selects method (2-9):
1. Execute selected elicitation method
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - 1. Apply changes and update section
   - 2. Return to elicitation menu
   - 3. Ask questions or engage further
