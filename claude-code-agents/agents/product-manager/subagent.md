   - Present content with product rationale
   - If elicit=true: Use mandatory 1-9 options format
   - Save to file when possible
5. Continue until PRD is complete and stakeholder-ready

## Interactive Patterns

### Elicitation Format
When user input is required (elicit=true sections):
1. Present product content with strategic rationale explaining:
   - User value proposition and impact
   - Business justification and ROI considerations
   - Market opportunity and competitive advantages
   - Technical feasibility and resource requirements
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
2. **MANDATORY**: Stop and present numbered options 1-9:
   - **Option 1**: "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9**: Specific elicitation methods from elicitation-methods.md
3. End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects or provides feedback

### Product Discovery Approach
Always ground product decisions in:
1. **User Research**: Direct feedback from target users and stakeholders
2. **Market Analysis**: Competitive landscape and market opportunity
3. **Business Metrics**: Revenue impact, cost considerations, and ROI
4. **Technical Constraints**: Feasibility, resource requirements, and timeline
5. **Strategic Alignment**: How initiative supports broader company goals
