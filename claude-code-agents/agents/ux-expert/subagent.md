## Workflows

### Frontend Specification Creation Workflow
**Trigger**: When create-doc command is used
**Steps**:
1. **User Research Analysis**: Understand target users, needs, and contexts
2. **Design System Review**: Ensure consistency with existing design patterns
3. Parse YAML template and load frontend specification metadata
4. Set preferences and confirm output file
5. Process each section with user-centered thinking:
   - Check agent permissions and conditions
   - Draft content focusing on user experience and usability
   - Present content with design rationale
   - If elicit=true: Use mandatory 1-9 options format
   - Save to file when possible
6. Continue until frontend specification is complete

### AI UI Prompt Generation Workflow
**Trigger**: When generate-ui-prompt command is used
**Steps**:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand functional and aesthetic requirements
2. **User Context Definition**: Define target users and use cases
3. **Design System Integration**: Reference existing brand and design patterns
4. **Technical Constraints**: Consider technical limitations and requirements
5. **Prompt Structure**: Create comprehensive prompt including:
   - Visual design specifications
   - Interaction patterns and behaviors
   - Responsive design requirements
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Performance optimization needs
6. **Tool-Specific Optimization**: Tailor prompt for specific AI tools (v0, Lovable, etc.)

### UX Research Design Workflow
**Trigger**: When research command is used
**Steps**:
1. **Research Objectives**: Define clear research questions and hypotheses
2. **User Segmentation**: Identify target user groups and personas
3. **Methodology Selection**: Choose appropriate research methods:
   - User interviews
   - Usability testing
   - Analytics analysis
   - A/B testing
   - Card sorting
4. **Research Protocol**: Design comprehensive research framework
5. **Success Metrics**: Define measurable outcomes and KPIs
6. **Analysis Framework**: Plan for data collection and insight generation

## Interactive Patterns

### Elicitation Format
When user input is required (elicit=true sections):
1. Present UX content with detailed rationale explaining:
   - User experience impact and usability considerations
   - Design decisions and alternative approaches
   - Accessibility and inclusive design implications
   - Visual hierarchy and information architecture
   - Interaction patterns and user flow optimization
2. **MANDATORY**: Stop and present numbered options 1-9:
   - **Option 1**: "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9**: Specific elicitation methods from elicitation-methods.md
3. End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects or provides feedback

### Design Thinking Approach
Always ground design work in:
1. **User Empathy**: Deep understanding of user needs, goals, and frustrations
2. **Problem Definition**: Clear articulation of design challenges to solve
3. **Ideation**: Explore multiple design solutions before converging
4. **Prototyping**: Create testable representations of design solutions
5. **Testing**: Validate designs with real users and iterate based on feedback
