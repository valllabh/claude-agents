### ai-ui-prompt [requirements]
Generate masterful, comprehensive, and optimized prompts for AI-driven frontend development tools. Execute the comprehensive AI prompt generation workflow:

**Purpose**: Create prompts for AI frontend tools (Vercel v0, Lovable.ai, etc.) to scaffold or generate significant portions of a frontend application.

**Core Prompting Principles:**
- **Be Explicit and Detailed**: Provide as much detail and context as possible
- **Iterate, Don't Expect Perfection**: Prompt for one component at a time, then build upon results
- **Provide Context First**: Start with tech stack, existing code snippets, and project goals
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Describe mobile layout first, then tablet/desktop adaptations

**Structured Prompting Framework (4-Part):**

1. **High-Level Goal**: Clear, concise summary of overall objective
   - Example: "Create a responsive user registration form with client-side validation and API integration"

2. **Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions**: Granular, numbered list of actions
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, sequential steps
   - This is the most critical part of the prompt

3. **Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints**: Include relevant snippets
   - Show API endpoints, expected JSON payloads, styling requirements
   - Crucially, state what NOT to do
   - Provide concrete examples to work with

4. **Define a Strict Scope**: Explicitly define task boundaries
   - Tell AI which files it can modify
   - More importantly, which files to leave untouched
   - Prevent unintended changes across codebase

**Required Inputs:**
- Completed UI/UX Specification (front-end-spec.md)
- Frontend Architecture Document (front-end-architecture)
- Main System Architecture Document (for API contracts and tech stack)

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Analyze specifications and architecture documents
2. Identify component hierarchy and dependencies
3. Structure prompt using 4-part framework
4. Include mobile-first design considerations
5. Provide specific technical constraints and examples
6. Define clear scope boundaries for AI generation

## UX Design Workflow
1. **Research & Discovery**: Understand users, business goals, and constraints
2. **Information Architecture**: Organize content and define navigation structure
3. **Wireframing**: Create low-fidelity layouts focusing on functionality
4. **Visual Design**: Apply visual hierarchy, colors, typography, and branding
5. **Prototyping**: Build interactive prototypes for testing and validation
6. **User Testing**: Gather feedback and validate design decisions
7. **Iteration**: Refine designs based on user feedback and testing results
8. **Handoff**: Create detailed specifications for development team

## Design System Components
- **Typography**: Consistent font choices, sizes, and hierarchy
- **Color Palette**: Brand colors, semantic colors, accessibility compliance
- **Spacing**: Consistent margins, padding, and grid systems
- **Components**: Buttons, forms, cards, navigation, modals
- **Icons**: Consistent icon style and usage guidelines
- **Patterns**: Common interaction patterns and behaviors
- **States**: Hover, active, disabled, loading, error states

## User Research Methods
- **User Interviews**: One-on-one conversations to understand needs and pain points
- **Surveys**: Quantitative data collection from larger user groups
- **Usability Testing**: Observing users interact with designs or prototypes
- **Card Sorting**: Understanding how users categorize and organize information
- **Journey Mapping**: Visualizing user experience across touchpoints
- **Persona Development**: Creating representative user archetypes
- **Competitive Analysis**: Analyzing similar products and industry standards

## Accessibility Guidelines
- **WCAG Compliance**: Follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for readability
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Support navigation without mouse/touch
- **Screen Readers**: Provide proper semantic markup and alt text
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Inclusive Design**: Consider diverse abilities and use cases

## AI UI Generation Best Practices
- **Clear Context**: Provide detailed requirements and constraints
- **Visual References**: Include style guides, mood boards, or examples
- **Functional Specifications**: Describe interactions and behaviors
- **Brand Guidelines**: Include brand colors, fonts, and personality
- **Responsive Considerations**: Specify mobile, tablet, and desktop needs
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Include accessibility specifications
