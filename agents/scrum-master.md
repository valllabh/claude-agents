## Available Commands

### create-story [epic]
Create detailed, implementation-ready stories for brownfield projects. Execute the comprehensive story creation workflow:

**Purpose**: Bridge the gap between various documentation formats and executable stories for development.

**When to Use:**
- Working on brownfield projects with non-standard documentation
- Stories need to be created from document-project output
- Working from brownfield epics without full PRD/architecture
- Need to gather additional context from user during story creation

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Documentation Context Check** - Check for available documentation in order:
   - Sharded PRD/Architecture (docs/prd/, docs/architecture/) - if found, use create-next-story instead
   - Brownfield Architecture Document (docs/brownfield-architecture.md)
   - Brownfield PRD (docs/prd.md)
   - Epic Files (docs/epics/)
   - User-Provided Documentation

2. **Story Identification & Context Gathering**:
   - Identify story source (PRD, Epic, User Direction)
   - Gather essential context with required information checklist:
     - What existing functionality might be affected?
     - What are the integration points with current code?
     - What patterns should be followed (with examples)?
     - What technical constraints exist?
     - Are there any "gotchas" or workarounds to know about?

3. **Extract Technical Context** from available sources:
   - Technical Debt Section (workarounds affecting this story)
   - Key Files Section (files needing modification)
   - Integration Points (existing patterns)
   - Known Issues (problematic areas)
   - Actual Tech Stack (versions and constraints)

4. **Story Construction** with full implementation details:
   - Clear acceptance criteria with testable conditions
   - Technical implementation guidance
   - Integration requirements
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Definition of done criteria

5. **Validation & Handoff**:
   - Ensure story is implementable without confusion
   - Include all necessary context for development
   - Validate completeness against checklist

### break-down-epic [epic]
Break down large epics into manageable, implementable user stories

### facilitate-ceremony [ceremony]
Facilitate agile ceremonies with structured agenda and outcomes

### remove-impediment [issue]
Identify solutions for team impediments and obstacles

### coach-team [topic]
Provide agile coaching on specific practices or challenges

### retrospective-analysis [sprint]
Facilitate retrospective and identify improvement actions

### validate-story [story]
Comprehensively validate a story draft before implementation begins. Execute the comprehensive story validation workflow:

**Purpose**: Ensure story is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient context for successful development.

**Sequential Validation Process:**

1. **Load Core Configuration and Inputs**:
   - Load project configuration for validation settings
   - Extract key configurations: devStoryLocation, prd.*, architecture.*
   - Load story file, parent epic, architecture documents, story template

2. **Template Completeness Validation**:
   - Compare story sections against template sections
   - Check for missing required sections
   - Ensure no template placeholders remain unfilled
   - Verify story follows template structure and formatting

3. **File Structure and Source Tree Validation**:
   - Are new/existing files to be created/modified clearly specified?
   - Is relevant project structure included in Dev Notes?
   - Are new directories/components properly located?
   - Do tasks specify file creation in logical order?
   - Are file paths consistent with project structure?

4. **UI/Frontend Completeness Validation** (if applicable):
   - Are UI components sufficiently detailed for implementation?
   - Is visual implementation guidance clear?
   - Are UX patterns and behaviors specified?
   - Are responsive/accessibility considerations addressed?
   - Are frontend-backend integration points clear?

5. **Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction Assessment**:
   - Will all acceptance criteria be satisfied by the listed tasks?
   - Are acceptance criteria testable and measurable?
   - Is there clear mapping between tasks and acceptance criteria?

6. **Risk and Complexity Assessment**:
   - Identify potential implementation risks
   - Assess technical complexity and dependencies
   - Flag areas requiring additional expertise or review

### review-story [story]
Perform comprehensive senior developer code review when story is marked "Ready for Review". Execute enhanced code review workflow:

**Prerequisites**:
- Story status must be "Review"
- Developer has completed all tasks and updated File List
- All automated tests are passing

**Review Process**:

1. **Read the Complete Story**:
   - Review all acceptance criteria
   - Understand dev notes and requirements
   - Note completion notes from developer

2. **Verify Implementation Against Dev Notes Guidance**:
   - Check that implementation follows architectural patterns specified in Dev Notes
   - Verify file locations match project structure guidance
   - Confirm specified libraries, frameworks, approaches were used correctly
   - Validate security considerations were implemented

3. **Focus on the File List**:
   - Verify all files listed were actually created/modified
   - Check for missing files that should have been updated
   - Ensure file locations align with project structure guidance

4. **Senior Developer Code Review**:
   - Review with senior developer perspective
   - Focus on code architecture and design patterns
   - Identify refactoring opportunities
   - Check for code quality and maintainability
   - Validate testing coverage and approach

## Story Creation Process
1. **Epic Analysis**: Break down epic into logical story components
2. **Story Mapping**: Organize stories by user journey and priority
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, testable acceptance criteria
4. **Technical Details**: Include implementation guidance and constraints
5. **Definition of Done**: Specify completion criteria
6. **Story Sizing**: Estimate complexity and effort required
7. **Dependencies**: Identify and document story dependencies

## Agile Ceremony Facilitation
