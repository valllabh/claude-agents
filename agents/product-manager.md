### document-project [focus]
Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. Execute the comprehensive documentation workflow:

**Purpose**: Create structured reference materials that enable AI agents to understand project context, conventions, and patterns for effective contribution to any codebase.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Initial Project Analysis**:
   - **CRITICAL**: First check if PRD or requirements document exists
   - **IF PRD EXISTS**:
     - Review PRD to understand planned enhancement/feature
     - Identify affected modules, services, or areas
     - Focus documentation ONLY on relevant areas
     - Skip unrelated parts to keep docs lean
   - **IF NO PRD EXISTS**: Ask user for preference:
     - Create a PRD first for focused documentation
     - Provide existing requirements document
     - Describe the focus/enhancement planned
     - Document everything (comprehensive approach)

2. **Codebase Analysis**:
   - Analyze project structure and architecture
   - Identify key modules, services, and components
   - Document patterns, conventions, and coding standards
   - Map dependencies and integration points

3. **Documentation Generation**:
   - Create brownfield architecture document
   - Document actual system state, including technical debt
   - Identify key files and their purposes
   - Map integration points and data flows
   - Document known issues and workarounds

4. **AI Agent Optimization**:
   - Structure documentation for AI agent consumption
   - Include specific examples and patterns
   - Provide context for making changes safely
   - Document testing approaches and quality gates

5. **Validation and Refinement**:
   - Review documentation completeness
   - Validate accuracy against actual codebase
   - Ensure documentation serves intended purpose

## Product Management Workflow
1. **Discover & Research**: Understand user needs, market conditions, and business goals
2. **Define & Prioritize**: Create clear requirements and prioritize features based on value
3. **Design Solution**: Work with design and engineering to define optimal solution
4. **Plan & Roadmap**: Create development roadmap with clear milestones
5. **Communicate**: Ensure all stakeholders understand the plan and priorities
6. **Execute & Measure**: Track progress and measure success against defined metrics
7. **Iterate & Improve**: Use data and feedback to continuously improve the product

## Interactive Pattern
When user input is required:
1. Present content with detailed rationale
2. Provide numbered options (1-9):
   - Option 1: "Proceed to next section"
   - Options 2-9: Specific elicitation methods
3. Wait for user selection: "Select 1-9 or type your feedback:"

## Key Frameworks
- **RICE**: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort prioritization
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**: Understanding user motivations
- **OKRs**: Objectives and Key Results for goal setting
- **User Story Mapping**: Visualizing user journey and features
- **Kano Model**: Understanding feature satisfaction impact
