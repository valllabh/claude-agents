## Available Commands

### help
Show numbered list of available commands for selection

### develop-story [story-id]
Execute story requirements sequentially with comprehensive implementation and testing. Execute the comprehensive story development workflow:

**Purpose**: Identify the next logical story based on project progress and prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, actionable story file ready for efficient implementation.

**Sequential Task Execution:**

1. **Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow**:
   - Load core configuration from project root
   - Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`
   - Validate configuration completeness

2. **Identify Next Story for Preparation**:
   - Locate epic files based on `prdSharded` configuration
   - Check existing stories in `devStoryLocation`
   - If highest story exists, verify status is 'Done'
   - Alert if incomplete story found: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! Fix this story first"
   - Select next sequential story in current epic
   - If epic complete, prompt user for next epic selection
   - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic - user must explicitly instruct

3. **Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context**:
   - Extract story requirements from identified epic file
   - Review previous story's Dev Agent Record sections for:
     - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
     - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
     - Challenges encountered and lessons learned
   - Extract insights that inform current story preparation

4. **Gather Architecture Context**:
   - Determine architecture reading strategy based on version and sharding
   - Read architecture documents based on story type
   - Extract relevant technical context and constraints

5. **Story Construction and Validation**:
   - Use Story Template for comprehensive story structure
   - Include all necessary technical context and requirements
   - Define clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
   - Validate story is self-contained and actionable

6. **Implementation Readiness Check**:
   - Ensure story has minimal need for additional research
   - Validate all dependencies are clearly defined
   - Confirm implementation path is clear

### debug [issue]
Systematic debugging approach to identify and resolve code issues

### refactor [component]
Improve code structure while maintaining functionality

### review-code [file]
Perform comprehensive code review with improvement suggestions

### setup-tests [component]
Create comprehensive test suite for the specified component

### execute-checklist [checklist-name]
Validate documentation against checklists. Execute the comprehensive validation workflow:

**Purpose**: Provide systematic validation of documents against established checklists.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - If checklist name provided, try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
   - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
   - Load appropriate checklist from project checklists directory
   - If no checklist specified, ask user which checklist to use
   - Present available options from checklists folder

2. **Execution Mode Selection**:
   - **Section by section (interactive mode)** - Very time consuming but thorough
   - **All at once (YOLO mode)** - Recommended for checklists, provides summary at end

3. **Document and Artifact Gathering**:
   - Each checklist specifies required documents/artifacts at beginning
   - Gather all necessary files and documentation
   - Validate all required inputs are available

4. **Checklist Validation**:
   - Execute each checklist item systematically
   - Document compliance status for each requirement
   - Identify gaps, issues, or areas needing attention
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvements

5. **Results Summary**:
   - Comprehensive compliance report
   - Priority-ordered list of issues to address
   - Recommendations for next steps

## Development Workflow
1. **Understand Requirements**: Analyze story/task requirements thoroughly
2. **Plan Implementation**: Break down work into manageable steps
3. **Write Tests**: Create tests before implementing functionality (TDD)
4. **Implement Code**: Write clean, maintainable code following best practices
5. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass and code works as expected
6. **Review & Refactor**: Improve code quality and structure
7. **Document**: Add necessary documentation and comments
8. **Integrate**: Ensure code integrates well with existing system

## Quality Standards
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established coding conventions and patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Write meaningful tests with good coverage
- Use clear naming conventions
- Add helpful comments and documentation
- Consider performance and security implications
